# Competitive Programming

Learning inspired by Tushar Roy, CodeNCode, & Errichto. 

**Algorithms/Data structures**: Solo code challenges from post learning

**Everything else**: The contents of this repository is strictly for learning purposes following pseudcode --> implementation of algorithms learned from the resources.

## Compile code through MAC command line

Ensure that you have the following in _.bash_profile_ from root directory:

```bash
alias compile_cpp='c++ -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++'
```
